# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-CNN
The project aims to develop an automated system for pneumonia detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Pneumonia is a respiratory infection that can be life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Early detection of pneumonia through chest X-ray analysis plays a vital role in improving patient outcomes. CNN, a deep learning algorithm well-suited for image analysis, can effectively identify patterns and features in medical images, making it an ideal choice for pneumonia detection.

Objectives:
Develop a CNN-based model capable of accurately detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images.
Improve the accuracy and efficiency of pneumonia detection compared to traditional diagnostic methods.
Assist healthcare professionals in making timely and accurate diagnoses, leading to improved patient care and outcomes.

Methodology:
Data Collection: Collect a large dataset of chest X-ray images, including both pneumonia-positive and pneumonia-negative cases. Curate and preprocess the data to ensure high quality and standardization.

Data Preprocessing: Apply various preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance the quality and diversity of the dataset, improving the robustness and generalization of the CNN model.

Model Architecture: Design and implement a CNN architecture suitable for pneumonia detection. The architecture will consist of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, optimized for feature extraction and classification.

Model Training: Train the CNN model using the prepared dataset. Utilize techniques such as transfer learning and fine-tuning to leverage pre-trained models and enhance training efficiency.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Validate the model's performance through cross-validation and statistical analysis.

System Integration: Develop a user-friendly interface to facilitate easy input of chest X-ray images and display the results of pneumonia detection. Ensure compatibility with different platforms and devices for widespread accessibility.

Expected Outcomes:
A trained CNN model capable of accurately detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

Improved diagnostic accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional pneumonia detection methods.

User-friendly software interface enabling healthcare professionals to easily analyze and interpret chest X-ray results.

A comprehensive evaluation report showcasing the performance and effectiveness of the developed system.

Impact and Significance:
Early and accurate detection of pneumonia can lead to timely interventions and appropriate treatment, reducing morbidity and mortality rates.

The automated system can assist healthcare professionals, particularly in resource-constrained settings, by providing a reliable and efficient tool for pneumonia diagnosis.

The project contributes to the advancement of artificial intelligence in healthcare and highlights the potential of deep learning techniques in medical imaging analysis.
